- MySQL-optimized query generation

**Interactive Data Visualization**
- Automatic chart type selection based on data structure
- Professional interactive charts using Plotly
- Support for bar charts, line plots, scatter plots, histograms, pie charts, heatmaps, and 3D visualizations
- Real-time data analysis and correlation matrices

**Enhanced Safety & Reliability**
- Multi-stage SQL validation (syntax, semantic, and database-level checks)
- Comprehensive schema awareness with foreign key relationships
- Strict security controls preventing data modification
- Intelligent table relationship mapping

**Professional User Experience**
- Chat history with persistent session management

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of four main components:

1. **AdvancedSQLPipeline** (`advanced_pipeline.py`) - Core SQL generation engine with full database schema integration
2. **AdvancedDataVisualizer** (`visualization.py`) - Interactive visualization system using Plotly
3. **ChatHistory** (`history.py`) - Session management and conversation tracking
4. **Interactive Interface** (`adv_main.py`) - Command-line interface with visualization integration

## Technical Capabilities

**Supported Query Types**
```sql
-- Multi-table joins with complex relationships
SELECT c.name, o.order_date, p.product_name, cat.category_name
FROM customers c 
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
JOIN order_details od ON o.id = od.order_id
JOIN products p ON od.product_id = p.id
JOIN categories cat ON p.category_id = cat.id

-- Window functions and analytics
SELECT product_name, price, 
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY category_id ORDER BY price DESC) as price_rank
FROM products

-- CTEs for complex data processing
WITH monthly_sales AS (
    SELECT DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m-01') as month,
           SUM(total_amount) as sales
    FROM orders 
    GROUP BY month
)
SELECT * FROM monthly_sales ORDER BY month
```

**Visualization Capabilities**
- Automatic data type detection and chart recommendation
- Interactive dashboards with multiple chart types
- Correlation analysis and statistical summaries
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Professional color schemes and hover interactions

## Setup & Installation

1. **Configure Database Connection**
   ```python
   # config.py
   GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key"
   MYSQL_HOST = "localhost"
   MYSQL_USER = "root"
   MYSQL_PASSWORD = "your_password"
   MYSQL_DB = "your_database_name"
   ```
